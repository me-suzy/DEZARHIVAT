1) Place this tag into your existing web page (remember to rename it to shtml extension):

<!--#exec cgi="yourfolder/vonline.cgi" -->

2) Upload either vonline1.cgi OR vonline2.cgi or vonline3.cgi to your cgi-bin and CHMOD to 755. If you upload it to another folder, remember to chmod the folder to 777. This is because a data file called vonline.txt will be created in the same folder.

3) To have a more accurate counter for total number of visitors arriving your website (any page), place the SSI tag at every webpage. Duplicate and rename your script and delete the very bottom section of it so that nothing is displayed at these sub pages. Both script should be pointing to the same vonline.txt file.

4) For more instruction, please see the description in the script itself.
