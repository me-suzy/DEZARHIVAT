Requirements:

1. Perl 5.005 or higher.
2. Unix based operating system (Unix, Linux, FreeBSD, etc).
3. The ability to run perl scripts outside your cgi-bin directory.

Installation and Instructions:

1. Unzip the file and transfer to your server with the following
   directory structure:
   /cgi-script <-- cgiscript.net script directory
   /cgi-script/CSFileshare <-- CSFileshare directory
   /cgi-script/CSFileshare/images <-- image directory for script.
   /cgi-script/CSFileshare/data <-- directory containing drive information. 
   /cgi-script/CSFileshare/desc <-- directory containing file descriptions.
   /cgi-script/CSFileshare/drives <-- directory containing the actual uploaded files.
   /cgi-script/CSFileshare/owner <-- directory containing file ownershiop.

  CSFileshare should be located at 
  [root url]/cgi-script/CSFileshare/CSFileshare.cgi where [root url]
  is the URL to your website. Example:
  http://www.mycompany.com/cgi-script/CSFileshare/CSFileshare.cgi

2. Chmod CSFileshare.cgi to executable (chmod 755)
   Ask your server administrator for assistance if required.

3. If your perl executable is not located at /usr/bin/perl, edit
   the first line of CSFileshare.cgi to reflect the true location.

4. Edit the following variables in the file setup.cgi (descriptions below):

   $cgiurl = 'http://www.cgiscript.net/cgi-script/CSFileshare/CSFileshare.cgi';
   $rooturl = 'http://www.cgiscript.net/cgi-script/CSFileshare/'; 
   $rootpath = '/www/vhosts/cgiscript.net/cgi-script/CSFileshare/';
   
   $cgiurl is the URL of CSFileshare
  (ex. http://www.cgiscript.net/cgi-script/CSFileshare/CSFileshare.cgi).
   
   $rooturl is the root URL directory of CSFileshare.
   (ex. http://www.cgiscript.net/cgi-script/CSFileshare/).
   Make sure you add trailing forward slash '/' to end of this variable
   
   $rootpath is the path to the root directory of CSFileshare
  (ex. /home/httpd/html/mycompany/cgi-script/CSFileshare/).
   Make sure you add a trailing forward slash '/' to the end of this variable.


5. Edit the file users.dat for the main admin's username and password. The file is 
   a colon separated database. The first field is the login, the second is the 
   password and the third is the security level. There are 2 security levels: 'user'
   and 'admin'. A login with 'admin' privileges will have access to the
   CSFileshare control panel to add, configure, edit, and delete shared drives. A
   sample users.dat file is provided with the default admin login as 'admin' and default
   password is 'password'.

   If the configuration variable $anonupload is set to '1', no password or username is
   required to use CSFileshare.

   If the configuration variable $anonupload is set to '0', usernames and passwords from
   users.dat are required.

6. Go to [root url]/cgi-script/CSFileshare/CSFileshare.cgi and click on management.You'll be 
   asked for your admin username and password. Enter those and click on the management icon 
   again once the page refreshes.


7. Click 'Add a Drive'.
   Enter the name, short description, file type limits, quotas, and autopurge date. Click
   Submit when you are finished. Now you have a Shared drive.


8. Click 'Go Home'.
   This will take you back to the main page of CSFileshare where you should now see your
   shared drive. Click on the drive to enter.
