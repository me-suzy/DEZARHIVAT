Description:

CSIncludes is a content management system to easily manage the server
side includes on your website. Many professionals use server side
includes on their websites for content that is the same from page to page
or changes on a regular basis. Server side includes allows you
to have one copy and distribute it among many pages, making it much easier
to manage. CSIncludes allows you to easily add, modify, and delete the 
contents of your server side includes (SSI).

Requirements:

1. Perl 5.005 or higher.
2. Unix based operating system (Unix, Linux, FreeBSD, etc).
3. The ability to run perl scripts outside your cgi-bin directory.
4. The ability to run server side includes (SSI)

Installation:

1. Unzip the file and transfer to your server with the following
   directory structure:
   /cgi-script <-- cgiscript.net script directory
   /cgi-script/CSIncludes <-- CSIncludes directory
   /cgi-script/CSIncludes/images <-- image directory.

  CSIncludes.cgi should be located at 
  [root url]/cgi-script/CSIncludes/CSIncludes.cgi where [root url]
  is the URL to your website. Example:
  http://www.mycompany.com/cgi-script/CSIncludes/CSIncludes.cgi

2. Chmod CSIncludes.cgi to executable (chmod 755)
   Ask your server administrator for assistance if required.

3. If your perl executable is not located at /usr/bin/perl, edit
   the first line of CSIncludes.cgi to reflect the true location.

4. Edit the following variables in the file setup.cgi (descriptions below):
   $cgiurl = 'http://www.cgiscript.net/cgi-script/CSIncludes/CSIncludes.cgi'; #<--script URL
   $cgipath = "/www/vhosts/cgiscript.net/cgi-script/CSIncludes/"; #<-- path to directory
   $username = 'demo';
   $password = 'demo';

   $cgiurl is the URL to CSIncludes.cgi

   $basedir is the full path the CSIncludes.cgi (don't forget to add a trailing '/')

   $username and $password are used to enter the control panel.

Instructions:

Creating New Includes
1. Go to [$cgiurl]?command=manage where [$cgiurl] is the URL of CSIncludes.cgi. Enter your
   username and password configured with the $username and $password variables.

2. Click 'Create New Include'

3. Enter an identifier and description for the include. The identifier should contain 
   alphanumeric characters and no spaces.

4. Enter your content for the include in the text area. If your text contains html, wrap the entire
   block of text with <html> </html>. Example:
  <html>
  <h1>This page contains html<hr></h1>
  </html>

7. Click 'Save' when you are finished.

Managing Includes.
Once you have an include entered in the database, you can edit, delete, or view it. To see your
include in action, click the 'view' link.

Displaying Includes.
The SSI code is shown on the management screen for each include. The basic format is:
<!--#include virtual="[$cgiurl]?id=[identifier]"-->
where [$cgiurl] is the URL to CSIncludes.cgi WITHOUT http://www.domain.com and identifier 
is the identifier you configured when you create the include. Example:
<!--#include virtual="/cgi-script/CSIncludes/CSIncludes.cgi?id=test"-->
