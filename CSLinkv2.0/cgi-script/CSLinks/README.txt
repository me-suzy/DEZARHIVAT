Description:

CSLinks is a management system for displaying links on
your website.

Requirements:

1. Perl 5.005 or higher.
2. Unix based operating system (Unix, Linux, FreeBSD, etc).
3. The ability to run perl scripts outside your cgi-bin directory.
4. (optional) The ability to run server side includes (SSI)

Installation:

1. Unzip the file and transfer to your server with the following
   directory structure:
   /cgi-script <-- cgiscript.net script directory
   /cgi-script/CSLinks <-- CSLinks directory
   

  CSLinks.cgi should be located at 
  [root url]/cgi-script/CSLinks/CSLinks.cgi where [root url]
  is the URL to your website. Example:
  http://www.mycompany.com/cgi-script/CSLinks/CSLinks.cgi
  (note: following this URL should give a blank page. This is normal.)

2. Chmod CSLinks.cgi to executable (chmod 755)
   Ask your server administrator for assistance if required.

3. If your perl executable is not located at /usr/bin/perl, edit
   the first line of CSLinks.cgi to reflect the true location.

4. Edit the following variables in the file setup.cgi (descriptions below):
   $cgiurl = 'http://www.cgiscript.net/cgi-script/CSLinks/CSLinks.cgi';
   $cgipath = '/www/vhosts/cgiscript.net/cgi-script/CSLinks/'; #<-- path to scrip dir.. Add trailing '/'
   $username = 'demo';
   $password = 'demo';

   $cgiurl is the URL to CSLinks.cgi

   $basedir is the full path the CSLinks.cgi (don't forget to add a trailing '/')

   $username and $password are used to enter the control panel.

Instructions:

Adding/Managing Links
1. Go to [$cgiurl]?command=manage where [$cgiurl] is the URL of CSLinks.cgi. Enter your
   username and password configured with the $username and $password variables.

2. Enter a description for the link and the link itself to the form. Hit the 'Add this Link'
   button when you are finished, the newly added link should now be displayed in the lower
   portion of the management page.

3. Once you have a link in the database, you can modify or delete it.

Displaying Links.
You can display the links with either server side include code (SSI) or a direct link.
  SSI:
    The SSI code is shown on the management screen for CSLinks. The format is:
    <!--#include virtual="[$cgiurl]?command=view"-->
    where [$cgiurl] is the URL to CSLinks.cgi WITHOUT http://www.yourdomainname.com
    Example:
    <!--#include virtual="/cgi-script/CSLinks/CSLinks.cgi?command=view"-->
  Direct Link:
    The direct link is also shown on the management screen. The format is:
    http://[$cgiurl]/cgi-script/CSLinks/CSLinks.cgi?command=view
    where [$cgiurl] is the  URL of your website.

Modifying the Display
The output of CSLinks is controlled by the file t_links.htm. in(linkdesc) is replaced
by the link description and in(link) is replaced by the link for each record in the
database. Examine the t_links.htm file for an example of how to create your own template
by modifying the t_links.htm file.
