Description:
csMailto is an automated script that allows the user to build and
manage multiple mailto forms within a web site. Build your own mailto
forms without having to learn Perl.

* Manage all your web site CGI mailto forms from one location. 
* Easy to use management screen. 
* Build your own mailto forms without having to learn Perl. 
* Choose from a pre-determined list of fields or create any
  number of your own fields: 
    Text Area 
    Drop Down 
    Text Box 
    Check Box Lists 
    Radio Lists 
* Add, Modify, Delete and even View your forms from one easy to understand
* management screen. 
* Include code added to management page for easy reference. 
* Allow users to send email attachments from the form.
* Advanced autoresponse configuration which has an option for file attachments.


Requirements:

1. Perl 5.005 or higher.
2. Unix based operating system (Unix, Linux, FreeBSD, etc).
3. The ability to run perl scripts outside your cgi-bin directory.
4. (optional) The ability to run server side includes (SSI)

Installation:

1. Unzip the file and transfer to your server with the following
   directory structure:
   /cgi-script <-- cgiscript.net script directory
   /cgi-script/CSMailto <-- CSMailto directory
   /cgi-script/CSMailto/attach <-- contains the uploaded attachments.
   /cgi-script/CSMailto/export <-- export file directory.
   /cgi-script/CSMailto/forms <-- forms directory.

  CSMailto.cgi should be located at 
  [root url]/cgi-script/CSMailto/CSMailto.cgi where [root url]
  is the URL to your website. Example:
  http://www.mycompany.com/cgi-script/CSMailto/CSMailto.cgi

2. Chmod CSMailto.cgi to executable (chmod 755)
   Ask your server administrator for assistance if required.

3. If your perl executable is not located at /usr/bin/perl, edit
   the first line of CSMailto.cgi to reflect the true location.

4. Edit the following variables in the file setup.cgi (descriptions below):
     $cgipath = '/www/vhosts/cgiscript.net/cgi-script/CSMailto/';
     $cgiurl = 'http://www.cgiscript.net/cgi-script/CSMailto/';
     $sendmail = '/usr/sbin/sendmail';
     $username = 'demo';
     $password = 'demo';

$cgipath is the path the the CSMailto DIRECTORY.

$cgiurl is the URL to the CSMailto DIRECTORY.

$sendmail is the path to your sendmail program.

$username and $password are used to gain access to the control panel.

Instructions:

Creating A New Form.
1. Go to [$cgiurl]/CSMailto.cgi where [$cgiurl] is the URL to the CSMailto
   directory. Enter your username and password.
   
2. Click the 'Create New Form' button at the top. Select the options and 
   fields for this form. There are many options available and instructions
   are on the page for each section.

3. Click the 'Create Form' button at the bottom of the page when finished. 
   The form should now appear in the management list. You can delete,
   modify, or test each form. There is also a popup window for each form
   to show the different urls to place the form on your website.


Displaying Forms.

The most affective way to place the forms on your website is to use server 
side includes. If you click the 'view' link next to the form name on the
form list, it will give you an example of the server side include code 
used to display the form. You would cut/paste this url directly into the
html page you want the form to appear. The 'Grab' button on the links popup
window will hightlight the text to make it easier to copy. Click 'Grab', go
to edit->copy on your browser, and then go to edit->paste in your html
page where you want the form to appear.

There is also a direct link to the form shown from the 'view' popup window
on the management page.
