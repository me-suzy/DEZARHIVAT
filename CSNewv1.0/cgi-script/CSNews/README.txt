2. Chmod CSNews.cgi to executable (chmod 755)
   Ask your server administrator for assistance if required.

3. If your perl executable is not located at /usr/bin/perl, edit

4. Edit the following variables in the file setup.cgi (descriptions below):
     $cgiurl = "http://www.cgiscript.net/cgi-script/CSNews/CSNews.cgi";
     $cgipath = "/www/vhosts/cgiscript.net/cgi-script/CSNews/";

Instructions:

Creating News Databases
1. Go to [root url]/CSNews.cgi where [root url] is the location of the script. 
   Example:
   http://www.cgiscript.net/cgi-script/CSNews/CSNews.cgi

2. Click the 'login' button.

3. Enter the username and password that were configured with the $username 
   and $password variables in setup.cgi. The default is demo/demo

4. At this point, you can either use the default news database or 
   create a new database. 

5. You can click the 'advance settings/security' button to fine tune the
   appearance and functionality of this news databases. You can also
   specify usernames and passwords that have the ablity to manage that
   particular database.


Displaying News Databases

There are many different options for displaying the various news databases
and individual news items. The easiest approach is to go directly to the URL
for CSNews.cgi. This will give you a simple index, along with a link to 
login and manage a particular news database.

To display the main index for an individual news database:

1. When you are in the management screen for a particular news database,
   clicking the 'Master Links' button will give you the code for a 
   direct link to the news index and the server side include (SSI)
   code for the same view.

To display an individual news item within a news database:

1. When you are in the management screen for a particular news database,
   clicking the 'Direct Links' button next to the news item will give 
   you the code for a direct link to the news item and the server side
   include (SSI) code for the same view.

In addition to displaying an individual news item, you can display its
full page by adding ',FULL' at the end of the url. Example:
http://www.cgiscript.net/cgi-script/CSNews/CSNews.cgi?database=test%2edb&command=viewnews&id=1,FULL

This would display the full page view for the news item with id='1'

To display the first item in the list:

1. When you are in the management screen for a particular news database,
   clicking the 'First Links' button next to the news item will give 
   you the code for a direct link to the first news item of the list and
   the server side include (SSI) code for the same view.

Displaying the first item of the list is useful for having a news item
displayed on your page that is updated on a regular basis. One example
would be 'news of the week'. The news item that is the first one in
the list would be displayed. As you add new items, they become the first
one on the list moving the previous first one down. The index view of the
news database could then be used as an archive.
