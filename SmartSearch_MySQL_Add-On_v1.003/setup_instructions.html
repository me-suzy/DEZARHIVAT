<p align="center"><u><strong>Smart Search MySQL Add-On (v1.003) Setup Instructions</strong></u></p>

<p><strong><u><font color="red">Setup</font></u></strong></p>

<p>Before installing the MySQL add-on, FIRST make sure that you successfully install
and configure Smart Search v4.18 or higher.  Using the MySQL add-on with a version earlier than 4.18
will produce unpredictable results.</p>

<p><u><b>Upgrade Instructions from v1.001 or v1.002</b></u></p>
<ul>
  <li>Copy listings.cgi to the "include" directory of your Smart Search installation and chmod it to 755
</ul>

<p><u><b>Upgrade Instructions from v1.0</b></u></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>
    If the path to Perl on your server is not "/usr/bin/perl" you will also have to edit mysql_setup.cgi.
    Place the proper path to Perl in the first line of the script.  You're now finished with your text editor.
  </li>  
  <li>copy mysql_setup.cgi and mysql_setup.pl to the main directory of your Smart Search installation
	and listings.cgi to the "include" directory.</li>
  <li>Set these files to file permission 755 (CHMOD 755).
  <li>Run mysql_setup.cgi or mysql_setup.pl
</ul></p>

<p><u><b>Installation Directions</b></u></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The first thing you need to do is create an empty MySQL database on your server.
    How you do this depends on your server configuration, but there is usually an option
    in your hosting account control panel to manage MySQL databases.  It doesn't really
    matter what you call this database ("smartsearch" isn't a bad choice), but remember that
    database name, along with the username and password that need to be used to
    access that database. You will also need to know the host name or IP address for your
    database server.
  </li>
  <li>
	Now, open up the included "mysql.cgi" in the text editor of your choice.  This is a very
	short file responsible for connecting to your MySQL server.  At the top of the file you
	will notice areas to enter your database server's host name, the database name, and a
	username/password combination used to access the database server.  Change these values
	to match your configuration and then save mysql.cgi with the updated information.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the path to Perl on your server is not "/usr/bin/perl" you will also have to edit mysql_setup.cgi.
    Place the proper path to Perl in the first line of the script.  You're now finished with your text editor.
  </li>
  <li>
  	Using an FTP program, open the directory on your web server where your Smart Search
  	installation is located.
  </li>
  <li>
	In ASCII mode, upload mysql.cgi, bids.cgi, listings.cgi, and search.cgi to your "include" directory.
	This will overwrite existing versions of bids.cgi, listings.cgi and search.cgi.
  </li>
  <li>
    CHMOD those four files (mysql.cgi, bids.cgi, listings.cgi, and search.cgi) to 755.
  </li>
  <li>
	For the next step, if you have many listings to copy from your current installation to a MySQL database, you will need to use
	mysql_setup.pl.  Otherwise use mysql_setup.cgi.
  </li>
  <li>
    Upload mysql_setup.cgi or mysql_setup.pl to your main Smart Search directory and CHMOD that file to 755.
  </li>
  <li>
    Either 1) Open mysql_setup.cgi in your browser.  OR<br>
	2) Run "perl mysql_setup.pl" from a shell (e.g. Telnet)<br>
	This will create the necessary tables in your database, copy any member listings to the database, and
    delete the now unnecessary files in your "keywords" directory.
  </li>
  <li>
	Remove mysql_setup.cgi (or mysql_setup.pl) from your server.
  </li>
  <li>
	If your Smart Search installation contains listings, you will now need to rebuild the keyword
	database.  You can do this from either admin.cgi > "Miscellaneous" or rebuild.pl from a remote shell.
  </li>
  <li>
  	Once the keyword database is rebuilt, you're finished.  You can now use Smart Search exactly as you would
  	use it without the MySQL add-on.
  </li>
</ul>
