Description:

csPassword is an automated system for creating and maintaining apache style
.htaccess files to password protect website directories.

Requirements:

1. Perl 5.005 or higher.
2. Unix based operating system (Unix, Linux, FreeBSD, etc).
3. Apache webserver or webserver that uses apache style
   .htaccess files.

Installation:

1. Unzip the file and transfer to your server with the following
   directory structure:
   /cgi-script <-- cgiscript.net script directory
   /cgi-script/csPassword <-- csPassword directory
   /cgi-script/csPassword/images <-- image directory.

  csPassword.cgi should be located at 
  [root url]/cgi-script/csPassword/csPassword.cgi where [root url]
  is the URL to your website. Example:
  http://www.mycompany.com/cgi-script/csPassword/csPassword.cgi

2. Chmod csPassword.cgi to executable (chmod 755)
   Ask your server administrator for assistance if required.

3. If your perl executable is not located at /usr/bin/perl, edit
   the first line of csPassword.cgi to reflect the true location.

4. Go to
   http://www.yoursite.com/cgi-script/csPassword/csPassword.cgi
   to initiate the automatic setup. Replace www.yoursite.com with
   your domain name.


Normal Installation Instructions:

In most cases, the script is already configured. Change the $username and 
$password variables to your liking and click 'Save'. If the setup portion 
of the script cannot find your sites variables automatically, you will might 
have to enter those in the above text area.

CGI-BIN Installation Instructions:

If your hosting service will not let your run scripts outside your cgi-bin 
directory, then follow these procedures:

Copy all the *.cgi files to a directory in your cgi-bin directory, making 
sure they are chmod'd to 755. For example, you could create a 
/cgi-bin/csPassword/ directory and place csPassword.cgi, libs.cgi, and 
setup.cgi if this file exists.

Create a directory outside your cgi-bin directory and copy all the remaining 
files and subdirectories there. For example, you could create a 
/cgi-script/csPassword and place the files there.

Edit the above variables (or manually edit setup.cgi) to the following:
$cgiurl = URL to the csPassword directory INSIDE 
          your cgi-bin directory (where the script is installed).
$cgipath = FULL PATH to the csPassword directory INSIDE your cgi-bin 
           directory (where the script is installed).
$rooturl = Full URL to your website
$rootpath = Full PATH to your website directory
ADD THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES TO THE ABOVE CONFIGURATION OR MANUALLY EDIT setup.cgi:
$htmlurl =  FULL URL to the csPassword directory OUTSIDE your cgi-bin 
            directory (where the remaining files where installed) 
$htmlpath = FULL PATH to the csPassword directory OUTSIDE your cgi-bin 
            directory (where the remaining files where installed)
            
For Example, your new setup.cgi file might look something like this:
$cgiurl='http://www.cgiscript.net/cgi-bin/csPassword';
$cgipath='/www/vhosts/cgiscript.net/cgi-bin/csPassword';
$rooturl='http://www.cgiscript.net';
$rootpath='/www/vhosts/cgiscript.net';
$htmlurl='http://www.cgiscript.net/cgi-script/csPassword';
$htmlpath='/www/vhosts/cgiscript.net/cgi-script/csPassword';
$username='myusername';
$password=',mypassword';
1;

(note: the '1' at the end is to prevent errors from perl if $password was left empty)


Password Protecting Directories:

1. Enter the URL of csPassword.cgi in your webbrowser. Enter your
   username and password configured with the $username and $password variables.

2. Click 'Create New Access File'

3. Enter a title for the protected area. This will appear in the 'Realm' of the popup 
   window that will prompt for the username and password in the client's webbrowser.

4. Either manually enter a path in the 'Identify Directory to Protect' field or
   press the 'browse' button. If you press the browse button, navigate to the directory
   that you want to protect, click the radio button next to it, and then select
   'set directory and return' in the action dropdown. If you manually type in a path,
   click the 'refresh' button.

5. Enter the usernames and passwords for who you want to give access to this directory.
   Enter each combination on a new line. Separate the usernames and passwords with a
   colon. 
   
7. Click 'Submit' when you are finished.

Managing Protected Areas.
Once you have a protection specified in the database, you can edit or delete.
