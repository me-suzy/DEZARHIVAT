Description:

csRecommend easily allows your visitors to recommend your site to their
family and friends.

Requirements:

1. Perl 5.005 or higher.
2. Unix based operating system (Unix, Linux, FreeBSD, etc).


Installation:

1. Unzip the file and transfer to your server with the following
   directory structure:
   /cgi-script <-- cgiscript.net script directory
   /cgi-script/csRecommend <-- csRecommend directory
   /cgi-script/csRecommend/images <-- image directory.
   /cgi-script/csRecommend/export <-- export directory.

  csRecommend.cgi should be located at 
  [root url]/cgi-script/csRecommend/csRecommend.cgi where [root url]
  is the URL to your website. Example:
  http://www.mycompany.com/cgi-script/csRecommend/csRecommend.cgi

2. Chmod csRecommend.cgi to executable (chmod 755)
   Ask your server administrator for assistance if required.

3. If your perl executable is not located at /usr/bin/perl, edit
   the first line of csRecommend.cgi to reflect the true location.

4. Go to
   http://www.yoursite.com/cgi-script/csRecommend/csRecommend.cgi
   to initiate the automatic setup. Replace www.yoursite.com with
   your domain name.


Normal Installation Instructions:

In most cases, the script is already configured. Change the $username and 
$password variables to your liking and click 'Save'. If the setup portion 
of the script cannot find your sites variables automatically, you will might 
have to enter those in the above text area.

CGI-BIN Installation Instructions:

If your hosting service will not let your run scripts outside your cgi-bin 
directory, then follow these procedures:

Copy all the *.cgi files to a directory in your cgi-bin directory, making 
sure they are chmod'd to 755. For example, you could create a 
/cgi-bin/csRecommend/ directory and place csRecommend.cgi, libs.cgi, and 
setup.cgi if this file exists.

Create a directory outside your cgi-bin directory and copy all the remaining 
files and subdirectories there. For example, you could create a 
/cgi-script/csRecommend and place the files there.

Edit the above variables (or manually edit setup.cgi) to the following:
$cgiurl = URL to the csRecommend directory INSIDE 
          your cgi-bin directory (where the script is installed).
$cgipath = FULL PATH to the csRecommend directory INSIDE your cgi-bin 
           directory (where the script is installed).

ADD THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES TO THE ABOVE CONFIGURATION OR MANUALLY EDIT setup.cgi:
$htmlurl =  FULL URL to the csRecommend directory OUTSIDE your cgi-bin 
            directory (where the remaining files where installed) 
$htmlpath = FULL PATH to the csRecommend directory OUTSIDE your cgi-bin 
            directory (where the remaining files where installed)
            
For Example, your new setup.cgi file might look something like this:
$cgiurl='http://www.cgiscript.net/cgi-bin/csRecommend';
$cgipath='/www/vhosts/cgiscript.net/cgi-bin/csRecommend';
$sendmail = '/usr/sbin/sendmail';
$htmlurl='http://www.cgiscript.net/cgi-script/csRecommend';
$htmlpath='/www/vhosts/cgiscript.net/cgi-script/csRecommend';
$username='myusername';
$password='mypassword';
1;

(note: the '1' at the end is to prevent errors from perl if $password was left empty)


ALSO NOTE: If you keep getting the automatic setup screen, then chances are your web
server doesn't have write access to the csRecommend directory. To work around this, chmod
the csRecommend directory and all subdirectories to '777'.


INSTRUCTIONS:

Go to:
http://[URL]/csRecommend.cgi where URL is the location of csRecommend.cgi on your server
Enter your username and password in the login screen

Follow the instructions on the management screen. In the text field for the message to send
out, you can specify the following values entered on the recommend form:
Your name: FORM(yourname)
Your email address: FORM(youremail)
Friend's name: FORM(friendsname)
Friend's email: FORM(friendsemail)
Comments: FORM(comments)

An example message:
FORM(yourname) wants you to look at this site: http://www.cgiscript.net

FORM(comments)


INSTRUCTIONS TO DISPLAY THE FORM ON YOUR WEBSITE.
In the control panel, click the 'Master Links' button. There are 2 types of links you can
use. One for a text link and one for a button. Cut and paste the appropriate code
on to your webpage.
