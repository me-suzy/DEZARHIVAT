paFileDB Classic Styles
By Todd - todd@phparena.net

These 4 styles are the same as the ones included with paFileDB 3.0 Final, however, they contain the old images used since paFileDB 3 Beta 1 (3.0 final has new images)

To use them, just upload the 4 folders* to the 'styles' directory, and in the paFileDB Settings section of your admin center, change the style set to "COLOR_classic"

*If you only want one of the colors such as green, just upload the 'green_classic' folder.
