This is the MySQL table name prefix. The default is "pafiledb" but if you wish to install multiple copies of
paFileDB on the same database, change this to something like "pafiledb2." All tables in the MySQL database will 
be named "$prefix_files," "$prefix_license" ect, for example: "pafiledb_files" and "pafiledb2_files." That will
allow multple copies of paFileDB on the same database. If you are only installing one copy of paFileDB, you dont 
need to change this. NOTE: Your host does not have this information, it is up to you to set it to what you want.
If you are upgrading from an older version of paFileDB, you MUST keep this as "pafiledb"
