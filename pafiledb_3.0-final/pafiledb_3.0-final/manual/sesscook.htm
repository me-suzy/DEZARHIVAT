<p>Sessions or cookies?</p>

<p>In order for paFileDB to keep track of who's logged into the admin center, it 
has to use either sessions or cookies to store data. Ever since paFileDB 2.0, 
sessions have been used, however they are not always supported on every server. 
Cookies are more widely supported on servers, however, some users with older 
browsers, or users behind a firewall might have problems using cookies. Some 
people just completely disable them.</p>

<p>In order to reduce compatibility problems, paFileDB 3.0 Final can use either 
sessions or cookies. Cookies are recommended and enabled by default, because 
there's less compatibility issues and unlike sessions, cookies don't require any 
data to be stored on the server.</p>

<p>If you're having problems with 3.0 final not logging you into the admin 
center or quickly logging you out, then cookies aren't working properly for you, 
and you will need to try sessions. Before you make the switch to sessions, make 
a directory called &quot;sessions&quot; in your paFileDB folder (same folder as 
pafiledb.php) and CHMOD the directory 777. If you are using a Windows server, 
you will <b>not</b> need to CHMOD the directory. If you've used paFileDB 2.x or 
a v3 beta before on this same server without problems, you shouldn't have a problem with 
sessions.</p>
<p>To switch between sessions and cookies, open up pafiledb.php and look for the 
text:</p>
<p><blockquote>$authmethod = &quot;cookies&quot;;</blockquote>
<p>OR:</p>
<p><blockquote>$authmethod = "sessions";
</blockquote>(That line of text will be different depending on what it's set to)</p>

<p></p>
<p>To set it to cookies, change the text in the quotes (&quot; &quot;) to &quot;cookies&quot; 
(without quotes)<br>
To set it to sessions, change the text in the quotes (&quot; &quot;) to &quot;sessions&quot; 
(without quotes)</p>
<p>Save and re-upload the file to your server.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Notes:<br>
--Cookies are enabled by default and are the recommended method. Only switch to 
sessions if you're having problems logging into the admin center. If you're not 
having problems, don't change anything<br>
--If you're using cookies, you <b>can</b> delete the &quot;sessions&quot; directory and 
all the files in it. However, if you ever need to go back to sessions, you will 
need to recreate the directory and CHMOD it 777 (on *NIX servers)</p>
