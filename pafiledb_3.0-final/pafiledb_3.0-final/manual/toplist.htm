<p>paFileDB now has a feature to allow you to show top lists anywhere on your 
site. On your homepage, you can have the X newest files, or X most popular 
files, with X being whatever number you want. The file that handles the top 
lists is toplist.php.</p>
<p><b>Configuration<br>
</b>There are only 2 things to configure:</p>
<p><blockquote>$show = &quot;10&quot;; //How many files do you want to show on the list<br>
$template = &quot;&lt;b&gt;{number}.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=\&quot;{filelink}\&quot;&gt;{filename} ({info})&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;; 
//Template for each line.</blockquote>The variable $show is how many files to 
show on the list (the X number mentioned before the config section) So if you 
set this to 5, paFileDB will show the top 5 newest/popular files.<br>
$template lets you customize the actual list. You can use the following 
variables to change the look:<blockquote>{number} - This is the file's position 
  in the list (If it's the newest or most popular file it's 1. If out of 10 
  shown files it's the 5th newest or popular, the number is 5)<br>
  {filelink} - This is the URL to paFileDB's View File page. You will have to 
  put the &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt; tag around it.<br>
  {filename} - This is the name of the file that will be shown.<br>
  {info} - This is info about the file. For the newest files, it's the date 
  added. For the most popular files, it's either the rating or total number of 
  downloads.</blockquote>
<p><b>Usage<br>
</b>If you are using .php files for your site, you can use this code to show the 
list:<blockquote>&lt;?php<br>
  $list = &quot;<b>TYPE&quot;</b>;<br>
  include(&quot;<b>/full/path/to/</b>toplist.php&quot;);<br>
  ?&gt;</blockquote>
<p><b>TYPE:</b> Set this to one of the following options to set the type of 
list:<blockquote>newest - This will show the top X newest files.<br>
  downloads - This will show the top X popular files based on the amount of 
  downloads each file has had<br>
  rating - This will show the top X popular files based on the rating visitors 
  to your site have given them.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><b>/full/path/to/ </b>- This is the full path to toplist.php. If you do not 
know the path to your files, you will have to ask your host. *NIX server paths 
are &quot;/full/path/to/toplist.php&quot; and Windows server paths are 
&quot;C:/full/path/to/toplist.php&quot;</p>
