paFileDB Image PSDs
By Todd - todd@phparena.net

These are the Photoshop PSD files for the paFileDB images, so you can change the color of the buttons, the background color, ect.

These were created on Photoshop 7, however, these should work on Photoshop 6.

The font used is called "Dungeon" and is NOT free, so it will never be included with this font pack. If you're interested in buying this font, visit http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily30885.html

You can only use these images for paFileDB. Using these PSDs to make images for your own script is NOT allowed.
